// Leg-shared glue for the jco conformance legs: the SUT import wiring
// (bindImports) and the thin suite loop over the upstream runner core
// (@polymorph/component-test-js — one harness for every runner, per
// polymorph-components/polymorph-test#5; the case loop, verdict mapping, and tag
// inventory live there, not here). Runs in Node and inside the browser
// page unchanged (the browser page maps the bare specifiers through an
// import map; see run-browser.mjs).
//
// Scheduling: the upstream loop mark-schedules against the tag
// inventory read from the transpiled core wasm. The suite is untagged
// and targets.toml declares no features, so `missing` is always empty
// and every case runs — but the inventory lookup still gates drift:
// a case the tags section does not cover fails the run as unsound
// (the jco analog of the wasmtime runner's cross-check).
//
// Cases run sequentially: the corpus is loopback-I/O-bound (~tens of
// seconds total), and sequential execution sidesteps Chromium's
// per-endpoint handshake serialization (the incumbent driver's
// HANDSHAKE_BLOCKING workaround) entirely.
